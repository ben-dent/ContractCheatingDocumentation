Data Analysis.py
===============================

This file handles all the analysis of the data collected by the tool, as well as currency conversion to USD.

Its functions include generating graphs, saving to CSV files and converting currencies to USD, using historic conversion rates

Currency Conversions

*getAverage*
-------------
.. code-block:: python

   getAverage(currency, startDate, endDate, amount)

This function handles converting currency by calculating the average conversion rate for the time period and using that to calculate a value in USD.
It takes 4 arguments

*calculateWeeklyAverage*
------------------------
.. code-block:: python

   calculateWeeklyAverage(currency, amount, weeksAgo)

This function will calculate the average exchange rate for a given week and use that to perform a conversion to USD.
It takes 3 arguments:

| - *currency*: This is the 3 character code for the currency from which the conversion is taking place

| - *amount*: This is a float that contains the amount of the currency to be converted

| - *weeksAgo* This is an integer that contains the number of weeks since the desired week

*calculateMonthlyAverage*
--------------------------
.. code-block:: python

   calculateWeeklyAverage(currency, amount, monthsAgo)

This function will calculate the average exchange rate for a given month and use that to perform a conversion to USD.

| - *amount*: This is a float that contains the amount of the currency to be converted

| - *monthsAgo* This is an integer that contains the number of months since the desired month

*calculateYearlyAverage*
------------------------
.. code-block:: python

   calculateWeeklyAverage(currency, amount, year)

This function will calculate the average exchange rate for a given month and use that to perform a conversion to USD.
It takes 3 arguments:

| - *currency*: This is the 3 character code for the currency from which the conversion is taking place

| - *amount*: This is a float that contains the amount of the currency to be converted

| - *year* This is an integer that contains the desired year for which to get an average

Analysis
^^^^^^^^^
*plotBarChartsOfBidderCountries*
---------------------------------
.. code-block:: python

   plotBarChartsOfBidderCountries(countryValues)

This function produces multiple bar charts to show the number of bidders from each country.
It takes 1 argument:

| - *countryValues*: This is a dictionary of country names (Strings) to integers containing the number of bidders from that country. It also produces graphs by continent.


*doAverages*
--------------
.. code-block:: python

   doAverages()

This function will populate the database with average costs of jobs (if the average is not already saved). It does this by calling *calcAverage*.

*calcAverage*
---------------
.. code-block:: python

   calcAverage(cur, jobID)

This function actually calculates job averages by averaging the costs of saved bids for that job.
It takes 2 arguments:

| - cur: This is the connection to the database that is passed in to allow for execution of SQL queries.

| - jobID: This is the saved ID of the job for which an average price is being calculated.

*plotFromDatabase*
------------------

.. code-block:: python

   plotFromDatabase()

This function reads in data from the program database and will produce graphs from it by calling *plotBarChartsOfBidderCountries*

*saveDataToCSV*
---------------
.. code-block:: python

   saveDataToCSV()

This function handles saving data to CSV files for easy analysis in programs such as Microsoft Excel.
Each table in the database will have its own CSV file produced.

*doAverages*
-------------
.. code-block:: python

   doAverages()

This function will calculate the average bid cost for each job in the Jobs and ReviewJobs tables and save them in the database.
It calculates the average using *calcAverage*.

*calcAverage*
--------------
.. code-block:: python

   calcAverage(cur, jobID)

This function will calculate the average bid price for a given job.
It takes 2 arguments:

| - *cur*: This is the database cursor object that will allow for execution of SQL queries

| - *jobID*: This is the ID of the job that needs the average.

*conversions*
--------------
.. code-block:: python

   conversions()

This function converts all job prices in the Reviews table into USD, at the historic conversion rate, and saves them in the database.

*jobConversions*
-----------------
.. code-block:: python

   jobConversions()

This function converts all job prices in the Jobs table into USD, at the historic conversion rate, and saves them in the database

*reviewJobConversions*
------------------------
.. code-block:: python

   reviewJobConversions()

This function converts all job prices in the ReviewJobs table into USD, at the historic conversion rate, and saves them in the database

*getDateRanges*
-----------------
.. code-block:: python

   getDateRanges()

This function calculates the possible date ranges for jobs saved in the Reviews, Jobs and ReviewJobs tables and saves them in the database.

*getKeywords*
---------------
.. code-block:: python

   getKeywords()

This function retrieves the positive and negative keywords saved in *positiveKeywords.txt* and *negativeKeywords.txt* respectively and returns them as two lists.

*scoreProjects*
----------------
.. code-block:: python

   scoreProjects()

This function uses *getKeywords* to retrieve the lists of positive and negative keywords. It then goes through the titles and description of each saved job in the Jobs and ReviewJobs tables and gives them an 'academic work likelihood' score out of 100.
