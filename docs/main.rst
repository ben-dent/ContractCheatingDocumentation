Main.py
========

This is the main file of the program and consists of a single class, Main.
The constructor of this class initialises the GUI and also any attributes to ensure visibility throughout the Main class.

This file imports the *Crawler.py* and *DataAnalysis.py* files in order to execute their various functions.

In addition to using the functions from these two files, it has a number of its own functions.

Setup
^^^^^^^^^

These functions are concerned with setting up the program and are called at the beginning of execution, if they are needed.

*getSeen*
----------
.. code-block:: python

   getSeen()

This function retrieves the jobs and profiles already seen from the database and updates a dictionary to hold their IDs.
This prevents data duplication and wasted time retrieving data already seen.

*setUpProgram*
---------------
.. code-block:: python

   setUpProgram()

This function sets up the program and then executes it. It creates the database and then calls *getSeen*.
After this, it uses *getAllTheRelevantLinks* to fetch all the project URLs and then runs *fetchDataNonLogin* on each of them that has not been seen before.

After running *fetchDataNonLogin*, the program will have retrieved the winner details so this function then calls *lookAtWinnerProfiles* to get all the details.

Creating database tables
*************************

*databaseSetup*

   databaseSetup()

This function creates all the tables in the database (if they do not yet exist) by calling the relevant function.

   createReviewsTable()

Creates the Reviews table in the database, which will initially be empty.

*createJobsTable*
__________________
.. code-block:: python

   createJobsTable()

Creates the Jobs table in the database, which will initially be empty.

*createJobsHourlyTable*
__________________________
.. code-block:: python

   createJobsHourlyTable()

Creates the JobsHourly table in the database, which will initially be empty.

*createProfilesTable*
______________________
.. code-block:: python

   createProfilesTable()
